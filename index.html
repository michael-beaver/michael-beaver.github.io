				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>
						I am a Software Engineer with experience developing
						various cloud solutions that run from bare metal
						to a full cloud. I have developed professionally
						with Go, Python, and Bash, and have used Kubernetes
						extensively. I pride myself on being the person that
						co-workers seek out for advice and help.

					<h2>Software Engineer II at Microsoft</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">August 2021 - Present</p>
					<p>
						At Microsoft I worked on the Azure for Operators team to develop
						a cloud solution to support a hybrid cloud deployed on client hardware
						which uses the the power of Azure for deployment and support. This
						technology is targeted at internet service providers as they
						(especially larger ones) have a need for large cloud solutions to run
						their virtualized network functions which form the basis of their networks.
						Not only would using a normal cloud service not suffice for this, one way
						that they distinguish themselves tend to be with the different locations
						and capabilities of their cloud nodes. These allow them to support higher
						speeds at lower latency, but increases the complexity of mantaining your
						own cloud. This is where our team came in to offer a solution to deploy
						a hybrid cloud on their hardware while still offering all the comforts
						of Azure. Our solution granted me the opportunity to work a lot with Kubernetes,
						Docker, Bash, Linux, Azure, and others. As for development I worked a lot with
						developing on custom Kubernetes operators in Go, writing scripting in Bash and Python,
						and interacting with unfamiliar technologies like Pure storage.

					<h2>Senior Software Engineer at AT&T</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Jun 2018 - Aug 2021</p>
					<p>
						At AT&T I worked on a team to create a private cloud solution capable of autonomously
						deploying bare metal nodes. The solution that was currently in place deployed OpenStack
						over the course of a month with the help of several operators. What we were developing
						was capable of deploying a new node from scratch in less than 8 hours. We worked extensively
						under the OpenStack and OpenDev open source area, and our main collection of projects, "Airship"
						was officially taken is a formal OpenDev project. This meant that much of my development was
						in the open source community, and I had plenty of interactions with the members of various
						other OpenStack Communities. Worked extensively with Kubernetes, Docker, and Linux
						system administration. Development utilized Python, Go, and Bash.

					<h2>Software Development Intern at Centene</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Jun 2016 - Aug 2016 | Jun 2017 - Aug 2017</p>
					<p>
						I worked at Centene as a Software Development for two summers while I was in college. My first
						experience there was very eye opening and I learned a lot about creating web APIs and working
						on a team. The second summer I was given increased responsibilities and the projects were
						considerably more complex. I worked with numerous technologies and gained a lot of experience
						from professionals both about writing good code and how to teach and lead others.
