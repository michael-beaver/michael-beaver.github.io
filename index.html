						gained a lot of experience from both of my internships, as well as being a technical team
						lead for a Software Development team on campus, and I am ready to tackle the workplace head on.
						I am currently looking for employment in a Software Engineering position. I would prefer the

					<h2>Software Development Intern at Centene</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Jun 2016 - Aug 2016 | Jun 2017 - Aug 2017</p>
					<p>
						I worked at Centene as a Software Development Intern for the past two summers. My first
						experience there was very eye opening and I learned a lot about creating web APIs and working
						on a team. The second summer I was given increased responsibilities and the projects were
						considerably more complex. I worked with numerous technologies and gained a lot of experience
						from professionals both about writing good code and how to teach and lead others.

					<h2>Technical Team Lead for ACM SIG-Game</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">January 2017 - Present</p>
					<p>
						I am a technical team lead for a software development organization known as SIG-Game. Each
						semester they put on a coding competition known as MegaMinerAI (you can read more at
						<a href="http://siggame.io">siggame.io</a>. This position has come with many responsibilities,
						including managing all facets of running the website, including using cloud services such as
						AWS, and hot fixing any problems as they arise. It has also fallen upon me to create a new
						website for the competition, to which end I have been managing my team using agile software
						development methodologies I learned from working at Centene.

					<h2>Undergraduate Researcher at Missouri S&T</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">September 2015 - April 2016</p>
					<p>
						I was given the opportunity to complete an undergraduate research project where I studied the
						new RFID chips in the S&T student ID cards to assess any security flaws that could be exploited.
						To this end I conducted much literary research of various methods of attack, and ended up
						implementing an Android application to that was the most likely of all methods to succeed.
